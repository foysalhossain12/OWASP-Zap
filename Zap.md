# OWASP-Zap

# ------------------------- Zap --------------------------------

### OWASP Zap is a security testing framework much like Burp Suite.

### It acts as a very robust enumeration tool. It’s used to test web applications.



# Why wouldn’t I use Burp Suite?


That’s a GOOD question! Most people in the Info-sec community DO just use Burp Suite. But OWASP ZAP has a few benefits and features that the Burp Suite does not and it’s my preferred program of the two. 



# What are the benefits to OWASP ZAP?



It’s completely open source and free.
There is no premium version, no features are locked behind a paywall, and there is no proprietary code.



# There’s a couple of feature benefits too with using OWASP ZAP over Burp Suite:

# Automated Web Application Scan: 
                                 This will automatically passively and actively scan a web application, build a sitemap, and discover vulnerabilities. This is a paid feature in Burp. 

# Web Spidering: 
                You can passively build a website map with Spidering. This is a paid feature in Burp.

# Unthrottled Intruder:
                       You can bruteforce login pages within OWASP as fast as your machine and the web-server can handle. This is a paid feature in Burp.

# No need to forward individual requests through Burp:
                                                      When doing manual attacks, having to change windows to send a request through the browser, and then forward in burp, can be tedious. OWASP handles both and you can just browse the site and OWASP will intercept automatically. This is NOT a feature in Burp.
